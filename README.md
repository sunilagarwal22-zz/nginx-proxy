# Application Redirection

Nginx container to perform HTTP redirection to HTTPS

### Prerequisites

* Docker 
* Docker Swarm (optional)

### Technologies/Tools Used
* Docker
   - Docker being a containerization tool is robust, easy to scale, provides functionality of OS independency. To scale an application, we donâ€™t need to create VMs but can have containers created on the fly on existing VMs.
* Docker swarm
   - Provides orchestration functionality. Takes care of all the containers across workers. 
* Existing images of 
   - nginx (alpine tag)
        Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I preferred to use nginx:alpine image as its being one of the smallest version of nginx. Does not require much time to download hence scaling up is faster.
   - http-echo 

### Installation

* **Docker Swarm** : To deploy the application, update the message (hello world) you want to return via http-echo image in web-stack.yaml file and execute below command

docker stack deploy -c web-stack.yaml <STACK_NAME>

```
Example: docker stack deploy -c web-stack.yaml myapp
```

* **Docker** : Update network name & container name in below commands and execute


docker run -dt --name <APP_NAME> --net <NETWORK> -p 5678:5678 hashicorp/http-echo -text="hello world"
docker run -dt --name <NGINX_NAME> --net <NETWORK> -p 80:80 -p 443:443 sunilthemaster/nginx:ssl

```
Example:
docker run -dt --name web1 --net mynet -p 5678:5678 hashicorp/http-echo -text="hello world $(hostname)"
docker run -dt --name webapp --net mynet -p 80:80 -p 443:443 sunilthemaster/nginx:ssl
```

## Unique features
* Error handling
* To make the site faster, have enabled http2 protocol in nginx conf

## Tests
* HTTP to HTTPS redirection: Access the URL http://<SERVER NAME>. Browser will redirect request to HTTPS. Browser will prompt for SSL certificate (as its self-signed certificate) and upon confirmation, browser will display the message provided in http-echo container
* HTTPS Access: Access the URL http://<SERVER NAME>. URL will prompt for SSL certificate (as its self-signed certificate) and upon confirmation, browser will display the message provided in http-echo container
* Remove webapp containers and then try accessing the app. Instead of showing "Bad gateway" error, application will gracefully show page not found message.


## TODO
* As of now http-echo is fixed to listen on 5678 port which can be parameterized.
* No cryptogrphic protocols specified in nginx.
